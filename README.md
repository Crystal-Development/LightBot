# This project has ended  
I am no longer working on this. I will still merge pull requests if they are good.  
If by any chance somone wants to convert my commands into their own ``.js`` files for implementation in  
my [new bot](https://github.com/crystal-development/supermemeboi-bot), that'd be nice.
